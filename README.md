# The-Green-Juice-Rack
 During my Engineering capstone, I decided to participate in The National Gillespie Business Competition at my University. Stress levels were prominent, but I produced my best work under pressure. 

Being the first runner-up in the Gillespie Business Proposal Competition for my concept "The Green Juice Rack" was a memorable and rewarding experience. The competition was highly competitive, with many talented individuals and teams presenting innovative business ideas. Despite not taking the top prize, I was honored to have been recognized for my efforts and the potential of my concept.

Additionally, winning second place in my university Landshark Spring Pitch Competition was a university accomplishment. The Shark Tank similar competition was a fast-paced, high-pressure event where participants had to quickly and effectively pitch their ideas to a panel of judges. Being able to perform well under these conditions and receive recognition for my efforts was a testament to my hard work and preparation in two days.

Overall, these experiences have been valuable learning opportunities for me and have helped to further my development as an entrepreneur. They have given me the confidence to continue pursuing my passion and the drive to make "The Green Juice Rack" a successful reality. I am grateful for these opportunities and look forward to future challenges and successes in my entrepreneurial journey.
